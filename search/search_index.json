Keys are derived using one of the following, based on the source key material: PBKDF2-SHA256 with a configurable iteration count (currently 200,000) if the key material is a password HKDF-SHA256 if the key material is a random key PZip also has the option to use raw keys with no derivation. The PZip format is essentially an implemetation of the STREAM protocol , a nonce-based OAE scheme. A random 96-bit nonce is generated by default for each file, but may also be supplied via the Python interface for systems that can more strongly guarantee uniqueness. When deriving keys, a random 256-bit salt is generated by default, but may also be provided manually. The ciphertext of a PZip file is split into some number of blocks. Each block is independently encrypted, prefixed with the length of the block (and a set of flags), and has a 128-bit AES-GCM authentication tag appended to the end. The nonce for each block ( Nb ) is calculated as follows, for block number B and original file nonce N : B is converted to a 32-bit big endian unsigned integer, and left padded with zero bits to be the same length as N . N is XOR-ed with B to get the block nonce, Nb .","title":"Encryption"},{"location":"encryption/#encryption","text":"","title":"Encryption"},{"location":"encryption/#overview","text":"PZip uses AES-GCM with 256-bit keys, 96-bit nonces (by default), and 128-bit authentication tags.

LEN bytes ... | +-----+-----+-------------------+ Negative tags are interpreted as big-endian integer values of whatever LEN is specified (i.e. 32-bit for LEN=4 ). Positive tag numbers are simply interpreted as bytestrings. Tag Values Tag Description 1 Nonce 2 KDF salt -3 KDF iteration count 4 KDF info parameter 5 Filename 6 Application 7 MIME type 127 Comment Encrypted Blocks PZip files are encrypted in some number of variable-length blocks. By default, PZip uses a block size of 2^18 (256 KB), but this may vary per file, or even per block. Each block is prefixed with a 4-byte header. The first byte is a bitfield of flags: Block Flags Bit Value Description 7 128 Set for last block of the file The remaining 3 bytes is a 24-bit big endian block size, so blocks have an upper size limit of about 16 MB. Each block is also appended with a 16-byte (128-bit) authentication tag (included in the block size). The remainder of the block is encrypted (and potentially compressed) ciphertext.
